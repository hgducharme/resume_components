\newcommand{\Meatball}{
\noindent
\textbf{Meatball - Chess Engine (work in progress)} \hfill March 2022 - Present\\
\textit{Project Link:} \url{https://github.com/hgducharme/meatball}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a chess engine in C++17 entirely from scratch
    \item Board representation: utilizes 64-bit integers to encode piece locations (bitboards)
    \item Move generation: pre-computes and stores each piece's attack space for each square to increase speed during runtime
    \item Created a recursive perft function to debug move generation by comparing the move space to known online results
    \item Move search (WIP): utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore the search space and decide on the best move
    % \item Move evaluation: a neural network trained with self-play reinforcement-learning to evaulate the quality of a position
    \item Developed the code base with intense focus on readability and maintainability
    \item Maintain a comprehensive test suite of unit and integration tests with coverage report generation
    \item Designed an isolated build environment and continuous integration pipeline using make, Docker, and Github Actions
\end{itemize}

\newcommand{\InvertedPendulum}{
\noindent
\textbf{Inverted Pendulum Control System} \hfill July 2019 - September 2019\\
\textit{Project Link:} \url{https://github.com/hgducharme/inverted-pendulum}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built an entirely custom inverted pendulum embedded system
    \item Derived the second-order nonlinear dynamic model using Lagrangian dynamics
    \item Converted the dynamic model to a linearized state-space model
    \item Built a simulation/validation environment in Python to help design the LQR controller
    \item Performed embedded software by implementing LQR control on a microcontroller using C++
\end{itemize}
